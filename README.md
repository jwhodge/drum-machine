# FCC Drum Machine App

### Link to live app - currently non-functional

The aim is to build a functioning set of drum pads that trigger a series of attached audio samples on click or with a keystroke. 

This is a freeCodeCamp assignment project. The brief is here: [Drum Machine Project Brief](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine)

## Design Inspiration

The design cues came from the old Roland Octopad midi controller which drummers & DJs used to add to their kits to trigger samples. The basic design aims to take this aesthetic and adjust it to fit the project brief (9 pads instead of 8).

I've found a google font called [Audiowide](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Audiowide) which has the feel of the old-school Roland style. I've pad branding as a wink to the original. 

Here's a photo of the original pad:

I have based the form factor round a iPad / tablet with the idea that a tablet shares some of the characteristics of an imput pad like this. I will alo have alternative screen size resets for common smarphone and larger screens. 

## Technologies Used

This is primarily a React project. At this stage, the state is handled by React only. 

I mapped out the basic structure using HTML/JSX and CSS grid. 

I chose to avoid using a framework or pre-processor although I may later go to SASS  to manage variables for media and themes.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
